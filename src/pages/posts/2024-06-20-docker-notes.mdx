## Goals

- Quick `hello world`
- Run and update a simple web server
- Create a react app with docker

### Quick `hello world`

```bash
docker run -d -p 80:80 docker/getting-started
```

```bash
curl http://localhost:80
```

### Run and update a simple web server

1. Download [getting-started](http://localhost/assets/app.zip)

2. Create a `Dockerfile`

```Dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN yarn install --production
CMD ["node", "src/index.js"]
```

3. Build a image named `getting-started`

```bash
docker build -t getting-started .
```

> Finally, the `-t` flag tags our image. Think of this simply as a human-readable name for the final image. Since we named the image `getting-started`, we can refer to that image when we run a container.

> The `.` at the end of the `docker build` command tells that Docker should look for the `Dockerfile` in the current directory.

4. Run the image

```bash
docker run -dp 4000:3000 getting-started
```

> We're running the new container in "detached" mode (in the background) and creating a mapping between the host's port 3000 to the container's port 3000. Without the port mapping, we wouldn't be able to access the application.

- `4000`: host port
- `3000`: container port (app server runs on port 3000)

5. Open a browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4000`

6. Update the `src/static/js/index.js` file

```diff
- <p className="text-center">No items yet! Add one above!</p>
+ <p className="text-center">You have no todo items yet! Add one above!</p>
```

7. build the image again

```bash
docker build -t getting-started .
```

8. Stop the container

```bash
# Swap out <the-container-id> with the ID from docker ps
docker stop <the-container-id>
```

9. Remove the container

```bash
docker rm <the-container-id>
```

> You can stop and remove a container in a single command by adding the "force" flag to the docker `rm command`. For example: `docker rm -f <the-container-id>`

10. Start the container again

```bash
docker run -dp 4000:3000 getting-started
```

### Create a react app with docker

> [How to Dockerize a React Application â€“ A Step by Step Tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-dockerize-a-react-application/)

1. Create a react app using vite

```bash
pnpm create vite react-app
```

2. Create a `Dockerfile`

```Dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /react-vite-app
COPY . .
RUN npm install -g pnpm
RUN pnpm install
CMD ["pnpm", "dev"]

```

3. Build a image named `react-vite-app`

```bash
docker build -t react-vite-app .
```

4. Run the image

```bash
docker run -dp 8888:5173 react-vite-app
```

5. Open the browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8888`
